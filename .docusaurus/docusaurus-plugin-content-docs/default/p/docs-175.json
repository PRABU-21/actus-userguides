Financial contracts are basic building blocks for finance, including cash flow agreements, risk analysis and nearly all financial reports. Standardized contract term specification and cash flow generating algorithms provide a basis for all further financial analysis. In particular, the ACTUS Standard facilitates forward-looking “what if” analysis, the ability to consistently and accurately consolidate financial contract information across business units of a firm or across financial institutions, flexible and robust data aggregation, and the generation of financial reports capable of drilling down to the most granular financial contract level for any number of future scenarios. This significantly improves the understanding of both risks and opportunities.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"dadfir3-demo/About":{"id":"dadfir3-demo/About","title":"Data-Driven Financial Risk and Regulatory Reporting (DaDFiR3)","description":"About the Project","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"dadfir3-demo/ACTUS Rshiny Demo Guide":{"id":"dadfir3-demo/ACTUS Rshiny Demo Guide","title":"ACTUS Rshiny Demo Guide","description":"This guide will help you install and use the ACTUS Rshiny Demo. This demo is a reactive Rshiny application that allows you to run ACTUS cash flow simulations on a single contract or on a portfolio of contracts using a selected interest rate risk scenario. When simulating a portfolio, you can select whether the results should be summarized as a plot of generated profits or liquidity balance and whether this should be a month-by-month or an accumulated plot.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"dadfir3-demo/Demo User Guide":{"id":"dadfir3-demo/Demo User Guide","title":"Companion User Guide for ACTUS Portfolio Analysis with Interest Rate Risk Scenarios","description":"Document Purpose","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"ACTUS Resources","description":"Introduction","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introduction/Benefits of ACTUS":{"id":"Introduction/Benefits of ACTUS","title":"Benefits of ACTUS","description":"Key Advantages of the ACTUS Standard","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introduction/core_activities":{"id":"Introduction/core_activities","title":"Core Activities in the Financial Sector","description":"Financial Contracts in the Financial Sector","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Introduction/Model-for-analytics":{"id":"Introduction/Model-for-analytics","title":"The Enhanced Model for Analytics","description":"This enhanced model provides a step-by-step approach to understanding financial contracts.
