# Overview on Risk Factor and ACTUS Simulation Script

Here we describe a script sequence of commands which:  
- Defines and stores some sample risk factors, and risk scenarios In the (mongodb ) risk factor store installed as part of ACTUS Basic Quickstart  
- define some sample ACTUS contracts  
- run  ACTUS simulations using the sample contracts and the predefined  saved risk factors  

The simulation requests return cashflows as JSON text strings.
